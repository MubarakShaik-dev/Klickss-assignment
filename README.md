Klickks - Full-Stack Authentication System
This project is a complete user authentication and session management system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It serves as a foundation for a photography platform called "Klickks," featuring a modern user interface, secure backend practices, and a seamless deployment setup.


Project Features
Core Functionality
User Registration 📝: New users can create an account using a valid email and password.

User Login & Logout 🔑: Registered users can log in to access the application and log out to securely terminate their session.

Session Management 🍪: Uses cookie-based sessions with express-session to maintain user login state across browser sessions.

Protected Routes 🛡️: The main dashboard is a protected route, accessible only to authenticated users, redirecting unauthorized users back to the login page.

Security
Password Hashing 🔒: All user passwords are securely hashed using the industry-standard bcrypt.js library before being stored in the database.

Environment Variables 🤫: Sensitive credentials such as the database connection string and session secret are kept separate from the codebase using .env files.

Duplicate Email Prevention 🚫: The backend includes validation to ensure that no two users can register with the same email address.

CORS Configuration 🌐: The server is configured to only accept requests from the deployed frontend URL, preventing unauthorized access from other domains.

User Interface & Experience
Modern UI Design 🎨: A visually appealing and responsive interface built from scratch using Styled Components.

Split-Screen Layout 🖼️: Authentication pages feature a dynamic form on one side and an engaging, auto-playing image carousel on the other.

Interactive Feedback ✨: The application provides clear success and error messages to guide the user through the login and registration process.

Component-Based Architecture 🏗️: The frontend is built with a modular and reusable component structure, following React best practices.


Improvements in feature:
You can add several great features to make your application more robust and user-friendly.

## User Account Enhancements
Password Reset 🔑: Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that sends a secure, one-time link to the user's email to set a new password.

Email Verification ✅: Send a verification link to a user's email upon registration to ensure they've provided a valid address before they can log in.

User Profile Page 👤: Create a dedicated page where logged-in users can view their account details and potentially update their information in the future.

## Advanced Authentication Options
Third-Party Login 🚀: Integrate social login options, allowing users to sign up and log in with their Google or Facebook accounts for a quicker process.

User Roles 🎭: Introduce different types of users, such as 'Customer' and 'Photographer', each with different permissions and dashboard views. This would be a significant step toward building out the full application.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 📱: Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a code from an authenticator app after providing their password.

Export to Sheets
Local Setup & Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)

npm

A MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Backend Setup
Bash

# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file and add your environment variables
touch .env
Your server/.env file should look like this:

Code snippet

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SESSION_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key_for_sessions
PORT=5001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
3. Frontend Setup
Bash

# Navigate to the client directory from the root
cd ../client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file for the API URL
touch .env
Your client/.env file should contain:

Code snippet

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
4. Running the Application
You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server

Bash

# From the 'server' directory
npm start
Terminal 2: Start the Frontend React App

Bash

# From the 'client' directory
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
